
# ConExConnector.cmd - the Conan Exiles (server) Connector

Join your favorite servers directly with the correct list of mods and let this script keep track of said 'modlist.txt'.

## Features

- Connect to servers with the correct modlist and thus without the need for Conan to restart itself.
- Reads the configuration (IP, password, etc.) from config files (one per server).
- Saves the current/last modlist with an autogenerated name where the script itself resides. (*)
- Speeds up Conans startup by disabling the intro clips/movies/videos. (*)
- Starts Conan with `abovenormal` priority. (*)

Features marked with (*) can be controlled individually in the config file for each server.

## Usage

__still2do__

OR
- create link to cmd-script and add the path to CECcfg.

## Limitations

- This script doesn't manage the mods by itself nor does it fetch them for you.
  You still need to use/allow Steam / Conan Exiles to select/manage/update them.
  It only keeps track of the modlist __after__ it was created/modified by Conan Exiles, so Conan still restarts itself the first time you connect and once every time the server changed it's modlist.
- If your Conan isn't in the default Steam-library folder this script will most likely not find it and you'd need to set the proper path in your config files.

## Notes

The script
- is untested with BattleEye since I don't use it.
- may depend on the OS language to work. So far it seems to work in English and German Windows without modifications.
- has only been tested a bit on Windows 8.1 and 10.
