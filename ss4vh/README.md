# SSound4Val.cmd - Surround sound for Valheim & more

Choose and change Valheim's surround sound configuration to your hearts desire.

Automatically add some GFX configuration options to VH's `boot.config`.

Switch VH's (keyboard) input method between 'normal' - respecting the users keyboard layout & language - and 'physical' - using key-codes instead.

---

## Features

- Reads Valheim's current speaker/input configuration and lets you change it.
- If it can't find the file to patch you can drag'n'drop it manually on the script file(!) instead.

---

## Usage

- Download the latest master branch [SSound4Val.cmd](https://github.com/l1m3r/cmd-scripts/raw/master/ss4vh/SSound4Val.cmd) (right click, *save as*).
- Run it & follow the instructions.

**Optionally:**

* This script can download the required 3rd party program [sfk.exe](http://stahlworks.com/dev/sfk/sfk.exe) on its own but you can download and [check/verify](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/41a48f6219888e35f0e56f6f97fd2c960eb4c1fe8ed1434a62cc22ee21e107c7/detection/f-41a48f6219888e35f0e56f6f97fd2c960eb4c1fe8ed1434a62cc22ee21e107c7-1683457704)(v1.9.8.2) it separately if you don't trust it (save it in the same folder or anywhere in `%PATH%`).

## How it works

This script uses [Swiss File Knife](http://www.stahlworks.com/swiss-file-knife.html) to modify half-a-byte in the file `...\Valheim\valheim_Data\globalgamemanagers` (no extension). It replaces Valheim's default value of "*2*" for Unity's [AudioSpeakerMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AudioSpeakerMode.html) with *4*, *5*, *6* or *8* for the respective number of speakers (4, 5, 5.1, 7.1). That's it.

Alternatively one can

- use [UABEA](https://github.com/nesrak1/UABEA) to edit the file directly (but for some reason leave a few more bytes modified).

- use any hex-editor to modify it manually (see the *source* for a *usable* hex search string).

- find a way to [get IronGate to just enabled surround sound](https://valheimbugs.featureupvote.com/suggestions/271742/enable-surround-sound-51-71) support in VH which existed since its first release (at least).

The input method is handled practically the same.

---

## Limitations

- only works on Windows...
- every update to VH seems to replace the relevant file. -> need to apply the patch after every update (maybe a *proper* mod using BepInEx would be better?).
- My hex search strings have worked flawlessly at least with all VH versions between January and November 2023 but there's no guaranty they will keep doing so in the future.

---

## Notes

The script

- may depend on the OS language to work. So far it seems to work in English and German Windows without modifications.
- has only been tested a bit on Windows 8.1 and 10.

-> Please give feedback on that ^^.

## Legal

As far as I can tell nothing in this project and nothing I did to produce it violates any law or license (copyright, IP, EULA, etc.).

And it seems to me like it would fall under "fair use" anyway because the *purposes is interoperability*(!) between Valheim and any setup with more than two speakers. Or to [correct](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=f5b1193c-f423-4f96-bca5-03f5145ecf15) [errors](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/w-030-8064?contextData=(sc.Default)&transitionType=Default&firstPage=true).
