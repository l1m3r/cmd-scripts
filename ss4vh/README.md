## Features

- Reads Valheim's current speaker configuration and lets you change it.

---

## Usage

- Download the latest master branch [SSound4Val.cmd](https://github.com/l1m3r/cmd-scripts/raw/master/ss4vh/SSound4Val.cmd) (right click, *save as*).
- Run it & follow the instructions.

Optionally:

* This script can download the required 3rd party program [sfk.exe](http://www.stahlworks.com/swiss-file-knife.html) on its own but you can download and [check/verify](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/41a48f6219888e35f0e56f6f97fd2c960eb4c1fe8ed1434a62cc22ee21e107c7/detection/f-41a48f6219888e35f0e56f6f97fd2c960eb4c1fe8ed1434a62cc22ee21e107c7-1683457704)(v1.9.8.2) it separately if you don't trust it.

---

## Limitations

- So far this script requires the correct path to Valheim to be stored in `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\Steam App 892970\InstallLocation`. Other options (drag'n'drop, etc.) are not specifically planned but possible future features.

## Notes

The script

- may depend on the OS language to work. So far it seems to work in English and German Windows without modifications.
- has only been tested a bit on Windows 8.1 and 10.

-> Please give feedback on that ^^.
